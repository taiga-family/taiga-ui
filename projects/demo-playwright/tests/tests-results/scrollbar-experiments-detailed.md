# Scrollbar Optimization Experiments: Detailed Results

This document presents a detailed breakdown of performance metrics from our scrollbar optimization experiments. All metrics were captured via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) by tracing layout and style recalculation events during automated scrolling of complex, reflow-heavy examples.

## Overall Performance Summary
