    Taiga UI supports setting
    <code>dir="rtl"</code>
    to implement right-to-left (RTL) layouts. This is particularly useful for languages that are read from right to
    left, such as Arabic or Hebrew.

    <tui-doc-example
        id="variables"
        description="There are a few CSS variables that would be helpful for you when implementing bidirectional interfaces"
        heading="Variables"
        [component]="1 | tuiComponent"
        [content]="1 | tuiExample"
    />
