    I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have
    money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career.
    Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will
    not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill
    you.
