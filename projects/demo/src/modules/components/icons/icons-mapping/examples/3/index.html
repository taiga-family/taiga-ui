There are two types of SVG gradients:
<code>linear</code>
and
<code>radial</code>
. They are defined separately from where they are used, which promotes reusability. But you should remember that such
svg files can't be reusable with tui-svg inside
<code>use</code>
tag. For workaround you need to provide (or
<a
    tuiLink
    [routerLink]="docRoutes.IconsCustomization"
>
    override
</a>
) src full path to svg file.

non gradient icon:
<tui-svg src="tuiIconPhone" />

gradient icon:
<tui-svg src="assets/icons/polygon.svg" />
