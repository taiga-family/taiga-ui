            In user interface design for computer applications, a modal window is a graphical control element
            subordinate to an application's main window. A modal window creates a mode that disables the main window but
            keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal
            window before they can return to the parent application. This avoids interrupting the workflow on the main
            window. Modal windows are sometimes called heavy windows or modal dialogs because they often display a
            dialog box.
